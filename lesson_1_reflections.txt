Viewing the two files using diff was great for someone like me who has spent
too much time viewing old and new files and comparing and contrasting like we 
live in the dark ages.
Being able to view all saved versions of a file will give you a much easier
way of debugging and possibly refactoring.
Pros of saving manually can be helpful if you know that you would like to
save at the end of a specific edit but can prove costly because it relies
on the human mind instead of an automatic save as in Google Docs. Essentially,
manual saving's pros and cons are the opposite of automatic saving. They are
sort of opposite mirror images of one another.
In a program like Google Docs, separation is better for security and usually
there isn't a great need to collaborate on documents to cross-compare. Or
you can always look at other versions from before. Whereas in Git, the need
to commit multiple files is important if the files have a strong interrelation
such as middleware scripts that tie into databases or front end components 
that rely heavily on one another to not break.
Didn't realize that I could use the down arrow to scroll down and see more
git commit id's and similarly in git log. Very interesting to see how it
makes it much easier to work with others.
It will ensure that I will not be afraid of making changes that can lead
to bugs because I know that I will be able to go back and check git log
to find the potential bugs.
I view Git in a completely different way now and I am truly excited to
use it going forward. It is always so rewarding to find out what 
a program can actually do for you when you overcome your fears and decide
to take a step back to take many steps forward later on. I already feel
like a better programmer!
