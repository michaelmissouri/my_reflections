The initialization of the repository will be helpful for looking
at the history of the directory and any possible commits etc.
You will be able to watch your changes more closely.
The staging area will let you watch and edit files
before you are ready to commit in case you are not completely
ready to commit any changes.
The staging area allows you to commit when there are logical 
changes that need to be committed and not anytime before.
The manual process makes this a natural option for developers
who only need to commit or save instead of auto-saving too
soon, too often, or too early.
It makes easy to experiment with new features or if you
want to refactor for instance. Also, being able to work on
different branches will allow many developers to work on
the same project at once without committing too early and 
possibly creating new bugs because everything was done on
the master branch.
The diagram gives me a visual of the branches that make
it easier to understand how they all relate one another.
Similarly, I visualize branches to reconnect at some
point in time to the master branch which when you visualize
can be seen as the tree trunk.
